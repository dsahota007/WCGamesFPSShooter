# Indie Project – FPS Demo

This project is an independent first-person shooter prototype, developed in Unity as part of a larger experimental game framework.
The current build demonstrates core FPS systems such as weapon management, player movement mechanics, perk upgrades, and a developing magic ability system.
All features are still work-in-progress, with placeholder visuals and unfinished gameplay elements.
